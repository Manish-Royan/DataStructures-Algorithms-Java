# Introduction to Data Structure 

### Definition of Data Structure 

Data structure are a way of organizing and storing of data in most efficient manner. A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. It define how data is organized, managed and stored. These data element (data structure) provide an efficient way of storing and organizing data in computer making possible utilizing them more efficiently.

### Why are Data Structures Important?

Data structures are fundamental in computer science and programming for several reasons:

1. Efficiency: They allow for efficient storage and retrieval of data, which is crucial for optimizing the performance of algorithms and programs.

2. Abstraction: Data structures provide an abstraction layer that hides the details of how data is stored and accessed, allowing programmers to focus on solving problems at a higher level.

3. Reuse: Once designed and implemented, data structures can be reused in different programs and applications, saving time and effort.

4. Scalability: Choosing the right data structure can make a significant difference in the scalability of a program, especially when dealing with large datasets.

### Propose of Data Structure

The main aim of data structures is to increase the efficiency of program and decrease the storage requirement. Data structure are a specific way of organizing of data in specialized format on a computer so that the information can be organized, processed, stored and retrived quickly and effectively. They are means of handling information, rendering the data for easy use.

Every application, piece of software or programs foundation consist of two components *"Alogrithms and Data"*. Data is information and Algorithms are rules and instructions that the data into something useful to programming.

    Data structure + Algorithms = Program

Hence, it is building block of program and crucial part of data management.

The purpose of data structures in computer science is to organize and manage data efficiently, with the goal of improving the performance or usability of algorithms and applications. Some of the key purposes and benefits of using data structures include:

1. Efficient Data Access and Manipulation: Data structures provide efficient ways to store, access, and manipulate data. For example, arrays allow for constant-time access to elements using an index.

2. Optimized Storage Utilization: Data structures can optimize the use of memory or storage space. For example, linked lists can dynamically allocate memory for elements, reducing memory wastage.

3. Abstraction and Encapsulation: Data structures allow for the abstraction of complex data relationships and encapsulation of data with related operations. This simplifies the implementation and maintenance of code.

4. Facilitates Problem Solving: Many computational problems can be effectively solved by choosing the right data structure. For example, graphs are used to model and solve problems related to networks and connectivity.

5. Facilitates Reusability: Well-designed data structures can be reused in different applications, reducing development time and effort.

6. Support for Various Operations: Different data structures support different operations efficiently. For example, stacks are ideal for implementing undo mechanisms, while trees are suitable for hierarchical data representation.

1. Linear data structure: Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. A data structure is linear when all the elements are arranged in a linear (sequential) order.

    #### Example of Linear data structure:

    • **Static data structure**: Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure.

    *Example of this data structure is an* `array`.

    • **Dynamic data structure**: In the dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. 

    *Examples of this data structure are* `queue`, `stack`, `linked-list`.

2. Non-Linear data structure: A data structure is non-linear when all the element are not arranged in linear (sequential) order. In this data structure `insertion` and `deletion` is not possible in a linear fashion and we can’t traverse all the elements in a single run only. 

    #### Example of Non-Linear data structure:

    • `Tree`

    • `Graph`
